/* NAME
 *   boids - simulate a flock of android birds from Brooklyn
 * NOTES
 *   (LS) This version eliminates the use of global
 *   variables.
 *
 *   The compute_new_heading() function is somewhat monolithic,
 *   but it is well documented at least.  Change it with some care.
 * RULES
 *   All of the rules have a weight option and a radius option.
 *   The radius option specifies how close a boid need to be to
 *   another in order for the rule to be acted upon.  The weight
 *   is used when combining all of the rules actions into a single
 *   new velocity vector.
 *
 *   The four rules can be simply described as follows:
 *
 *      Centering: move towards the center of any boids in my
 *                 viewing area.
 *
 *      Copying: attempt to move in the average direction of
 *               that all boids that can be seen are moving
 *               in.
 *
 *      Avoidance: ``Please don't stand so close to me.''
				  Move away from any close flyers.
 *
 *      Visual: move in such a way that the bonehead
 *              obstructing your view no longer interferes.
 *
 *   The four rules are then normalized and added together to make
 *   the next velocity vector of the boid.  All radii in the rules
 *   are in terms of pixels.
 *
 *   You may wish to try turning on and off different combinations
 *   of the rules to see how the boids' behaviors change.  For example,
 *   if you turn off the avoidance rule, increase the centering radius
 *   and weight, and increase the viewing angle to nearly 360 degrees,
 *   then the boids will behave like a pack of wolves fighting over
 *   the center.  Other changes can yield similar surprises.
 * BUGS
 *   No sanity checks are performed to make sure that any of the
 *   options make sense.
